# Bike Sharing Multiple Linear Regression Assignment
BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has experienced a revenue decline due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To recover, they plan to understand the factors influencing bike demand after the pandemic to create a strategic business plan. They have hired a consulting firm to identify key variables affecting bike demand in the American market, using a large dataset on daily bike usage.

## General Information
A bike-sharing system provides bicycles for short-term use, either for a fee or free of charge, allowing users to pick up a bike from a computer-controlled dock and return it to another dock within the same network. BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has faced significant revenue losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic and is struggling to stay afloat. To recover, the company is devising a strategic business plan to boost revenue once the lockdown ends and the economy recovers.

To achieve this, BoomBikes aims to understand the post-pandemic demand for shared bikes across the country. They plan to leverage this understanding to better serve customer needs, outpace competitors, and increase profits. To gain insights into the factors influencing bike demand, BoomBikes has hired a consulting firm. The goal is to identify which variables are most significant in predicting bike demand in the American market and how accurately these variables explain the demand. To support this analysis, BoomBikes has compiled a large dataset on daily bike usage across the US, considering various factors such as weather conditions and consumer behavior.


## Conclusions
Company should focus more on september month in spring season can launch multiple offers to get more engagement when temprature is and weather is pleasant.
